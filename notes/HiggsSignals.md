## Higgs signals in collider searches

 Most searches for Higgs bosons at the LHC are performed under the assumption of the SM. This fixes completely the couplings of the Higgs state to fermions and vector bosons, and both the cross sections and branching ratios are fully specified as a function of the Higgs boson mass, $m_H$ .
 
 This leads to experiment to measure **signal strength modifiers $\hat{\mu}$**, scalings of the total SM rate of a certain (ensemble of) signal channel(s) .

 > The idea of **HiggsSignals** is to compare the experimental measurements of signal strength modifiers to the Higgs sector predictions in arbitrary models.
